        <h2> Eye of the Tiger</h2>
        <h3>By Survivor</h3>
        <p class="activity-lyrics"> 
            Rising up, back on the street <br>
            Did my time, took my chances <br>
            Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet <br>
            Just a man and his will to survive<br><br>
            So many times it happens too fast <br>
            You trade your passion for glory <br>
            Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br>
            You must fight just to keep them alive<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="activity-lyrics"> 
            It's the eye of the tiger <br>
            It's the thrill of the fight <br>
            Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
            And the last known survivor <br>
            Stalks his prey in the night<br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="activity-lyrics"> 
            Face to face, out in the heat <br>
            Hanging tough, staying hungry <br>
            They stack the odds 'til we take to the street <br>
            For the kill with the skill to survive<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="activity-lyrics"> 
            Rising up, straight to the top <br>
            Had the guts, got the glory <br>
            Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop <br>
            Just a man and his will to survive<br>
